**Why it matters:**
Financial institutions need to assess borrower risk accurately. Approving loans for high-risk applicants leads to financial loss; rejecting low-risk ones limits growth.

**Objective:**
Develop a predictive model that balances **recall** (catching defaulters) and **precision** (avoiding false alarms) to guide smarter lending.
